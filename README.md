### Integraal Klant & Objectbeeld (IKO)

IKO is a Kotlin/Spring Boot application that uses Apache Camel to integrate with external systems via connectors. It ships with an admin UI and a Docker-based local environment.

---

### Features
- Spring Boot 3.5.x, Kotlin 2.2, JDK 21
- Apache Camel routes (YAML DSL) auto-discovered from `classpath:camel/*.yaml`
- OAuth2 (Keycloak) for admin login and JWT resource server
- Connectors for BRP, OpenZaak, BAG, Objecten API, OpenKlant (configurable via environment)
- Dockerfile for containerized runs and GitHub Actions CI/CD

---

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- GitHub account (to use CI/CD workflows)
- For local development: JDK 21 and Gradle wrapper

---

### Quick start with Docker
1. Start the local stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
2. Add a hosts entry so Keycloak tokens use the hostname expected by configuration:
   ```text
   127.0.0.1 keycloak
   ```
3. Open the admin UI: `http://localhost:8080/admin`

Notes:
- The shipped `Dockerfile` (repo root) builds a runnable IKO container.
- The compose file provides dependent services and sets up Keycloak for local login.

---

### Local development
- Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and adjust values to your local setup.
- For HTML live-refresh during local dev only, `.env.template` includes:
  ```
  SPRING_THYMELEAF_PREFIX=file:src/main/resources/templates/
  # SPRING_WEB_RESOURCES_STATIC-LOCATIONS=file:src/main/resources/static/
  ```
  Remove or comment these when running inside Docker (the application defaults to classpath locations in `application.yml`).
- Run the app via Gradle (env injected by the Dotenv Gradle plugin):
  ```bash
  ./gradlew bootRun
  ```

---

### Configuration overview
- Main config: `src/main/resources/application.yml`
    - Disables OSIV (`spring.jpa.open-in-view=false`)
    - Camel YAML routes path: `classpath:camel/*.yaml`
    - Security: OAuth2 client for admin and JWT resource server; authorities from claim `resource_access.iko.roles`
- Connector properties are under `iko.connectors.*` and can be provided via environment variables. See `.env.template` for examples.

---

### Build and test
- Run tests:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew test
  ```
- Build the application JAR:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew build
  ```
- Build a local Docker image:
  ```bash
  docker build -t iko:local .
  ```

---

### Admin UI
- URL: `http://localhost:8080/admin`

### CI/CD

#### Snapshot workflow (`.github/workflows/snapshot-releases.yml`)
- Triggered on `push` and `pull_request` to `main`.
- Builds the Docker image with Buildx (single-arch `linux/amd64`).
- On `push` to `main`, pushes to GHCR (`ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>`) with tags such as:
    - `main` (default branch)
    - `sha-<short>`
    - `snapshot-YYYYMMDD`
    - `branch-<name>` for non-main branches (not pushed for PRs)
- Adds OCI labels/annotations (title, description, revision, source, created).

#### Manual release workflow (`.github/workflows/start-manual-release.yml`)
This workflow is used to cut a formal release that publishes a versioned container image and a GitHub Release.

- Trigger: manually via the Actions tab (`workflow_dispatch`).
- Input: `version` — a semantic version like `1.2.3` or `1.2.3-beta.1` (no leading `v`). The workflow validates this with a semver regex.
- Permissions: `contents: write` (create GitHub Release) and `packages: write` (push to GHCR).

How it works (two-job pipeline):
1. `build` job
    - Checks out code, sets up QEMU and Buildx.
    - Extracts Docker metadata for consistent OCI labels.
    - Builds the Docker image once and exports it as a `docker`-format TAR (`iko-image.tar`) tagged locally as `iko:iko-<epoch_seconds>`.
    - Uploads the TAR as a short-lived artifact.
2. `push` job
    - Downloads the image artifact and logs into GHCR with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
    - Loads the image from the TAR and retags it as:
        - `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:<version>`
        - `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:latest`
    - Pushes both tags.
    - Creates a GitHub Release with tag `v<version>` and autogenerated release notes. If the version contains a `-` (e.g., `-rc.1`), the release is marked as a prerelease.

When to use it:
- Use `start-manual-release.yml` when you are ready to publish a stable or pre-release version to consumers.
- Use `snapshot-releases.yml` for continuous builds on `main` or for verifying PRs.

How to run a manual release:
1. Go to GitHub → Actions → `Start release`.
2. Click `Run workflow` and enter a semver (e.g., `1.3.0` or `1.3.0-rc.1`).
3. Confirm to start. After completion you will have:
    - GHCR images: `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:<version>` and `:latest`.
    - GitHub Release: tag `v<version>` with autogenerated notes.

Notes and gotchas:
- Architecture: currently builds for `linux/amd64` only. Adjust `platforms` if you need multi-arch.
- Input version must be plain semver (e.g., `1.2.3`), not `v1.2.3`.
- The artifact retention is short (1 day) to avoid stale reuse; the image is built once and then retagged/pushed in the separate job.

### Crypto
IKO uses AES encryption for config storage of connectors. 
Please generate a Base64 key in the env var IKO_CRYPTO_KEY via the .env file for local development.

Kotlin notebook code helps run pieces of code or just ask AI.
```Kotlin
fun generateBase64AesKey(keySize: Int = 256): String {
    val keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES")
    keyGen.init(keySize, SecureRandom())
    val secretKey: SecretKey = keyGen.generateKey()
    return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(secretKey.encoded)
}

fun main() {
    val base64Key = generateBase64AesKey()
    println("Generated AES key (Base64): $base64Key")
}
main()
```
