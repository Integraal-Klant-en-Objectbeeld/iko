### Docker container steps:
* Building
```./gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=iko-app```
or (then image name will be docker.io/library/iko:X.X.X-SNAPSHOT)
```./gradlew bootBuildImage```
* Running: 
```docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 iko-app```
or
```docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 docker.io/library/iko:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT```

The env.template file contains a SPRING_THYMELEAF_PREFIX=file:src/main/resources/templates/
This is to allow local dev to have no caching when working on HTML. Remove it when running the docker container.
